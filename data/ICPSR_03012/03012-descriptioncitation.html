								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>The purpose of this project was to measure and estimate the
distribution of personal income in both rural and urban areas of the
People's Republic of China. The principal investigators based their
definition of income on cash payments and on a broad range of
additional components: payments in kind valued at market prices,
agricultural output produced for self-consumption valued at market
prices, the value of food and other direct subsidies, and the imputed
value of housing services. The rural component of this collection
consists of two data files, one in which the individual is the unit of
analysis (Part 1) and a second in which the household is the unit of
analysis (Part 2). Individual rural respondents reported on their employment
status, level of education, Communist Party membership, type of
employer (e.g., public, private, or foreign), type of economic sector
in which they were employed, occupation, whether they held a second job,
retirement status, monthly pension, monthly wage, and other sources of
income. Demographic variables include relationship to householder,
gender, age, and student status. Rural households reported extensively
on the character of the household and residence. Information was
elicited on type of terrain surrounding the house, geographic
position, type of house, and availability of electricity. Also
reported were sources of household income (e.g., farming, industry,
government, rents, and interest), taxes paid, value of farm, total
amount and type of cultivated land, financial assets and debts,
quantity and value of various crops, amount of grain purchased or
provided by a collective, use of chemical fertilizers, gasoline, and
oil, quantity and value of agricultural machinery, and all household
expenditures (e.g., food, fuel, medicine, education, transportation,
and electricity). The urban component of this collection also consists
of two data files, one in which the individual is the unit of analysis (Part 3)
and a second in which the household is the unit of analysis (Part 4).
Individual urban respondents reported on their economic status within
the household, Communist Party membership, sex, age, nature of
employment, and relationship to the household head. Information was
collected on all types and sources of income from each member of the
household whether working, nonworking, or retired, all revenue
received by owners of private or individual enterprises, and all
in-kind payments (e.g., food, durable goods, and nondurable goods). Urban
households reported total income (including salaries, interest on
savings and bonds, dividends, rent, leases, alimony, gifts, and
boarding fees), all types and values of food subsidies received, and
total debt. Information was also gathered on household accommodations
and living conditions, including number of rooms, total living area in
square meters, availability and cost of running water, sanitary
facilities, heating and air-conditioning equipment, kitchen
availability, location of residence, ownership of home, and
availability of electricity and telephone. Households reported on all
their expenditures including amounts spent on food items such as
wheat, rice, edible oils, pork, beef and mutton, poultry, fish and
seafood, sugar, and vegetables by means of coupons in state-owned
stores and at free market prices. Information was also collected on
rents paid by the households, fuel available, type of transportation
used, and availability and use of medical and child care.</p>
<p>The Chinese Household Income Project collected data in 1988, 1995, 2002, and 2007. ICPSR holds data from the first three collections, and information about these can be found on the  <a href="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/243">series description page</a>. Data collected in 2007 are available through the  <a href="http://www.ciidbnu.org/chip/chips.asp?year=2007">China Institute for Income Distribution</a>.</p></span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Date of Collection:</strong> 1995</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Collection Notes:</strong> The data are provided as SAS transport files that
were created using the SAS XPORT engine., Users may disaggregate
the data down to the county level through use of the Codes for the
Administrative Divisions of the People's Republic of China (in
Chinese) issued by the State Statistical Bureau., The Chinese
Household Income Project is a joint research effort sponsored by the
Institute of Economics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Asian
Development Bank, and the Ford Foundation. Additional support was
provided by the East Asian Institute, Columbia University., This
collection has not been processed by ICPSR staff. ICPSR is
distributing the data and documentation for this collection in
essentially the same form in which they were received. When
appropriate, documentation has been converted to Portable Document
Format (PDF), data files have been converted to non-platform-specific
formats, and variables have been recoded to ensure respondents'
anonymity.</span></p>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> The data collection consists of two distinct samples of
the urban and rural populations of the People's Republic of China,
which were selected from significantly larger samples (approximately
65,000 rural households and 35,000 urban households) drawn by the
State Statistical Bureau.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> Resident population of the People's Republic of China.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> face-to-face interview</span></p>

Made data available in SAS, SPSS, Stata, ASCII with setup files, and tab-delimited ASCII., 2006-01-18 File QU3012.ALL.PDF was removed from any previous datasets and flagged as a study-level file, so that it will accompany all downloads., 2006-01-18 File CB3012.ALL.PDF was removed from any previous datasets and flagged as a study-level file, so that it will accompany all downloads., <p>2000-11-10 ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Performed consistency checks.</li><li>Created variable labels and/or value labels.</li><li>Created online analysis version with question text.</li><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></span></p>
